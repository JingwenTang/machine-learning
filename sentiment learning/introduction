Learn to identify the attitudes of reviews sentences. 
Compare different ensemble learning algorithms with different base classifiers.
Two ensemble learning algorithms are required (Bagging and AdaBoost.M1); 
and two base classifiers are required (SVM and Decision Tree). 
Thus, you should at least compare 4 combinations: Bagging + DTree, Bagging + SVM, AdaBoost.M1 + DTree, AdaBoost.M1 + SVM.
